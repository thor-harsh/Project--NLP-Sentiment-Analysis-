# Project--NLP-Sentiment-Analysis-

<table>
  
**In this project we'll be doing vector arithmetic our own words and then we will perform VADER sentiment analysis on your own review as positive, negative, neutral or compound in Natural Language Processing.** <br></br>


**Before jumping to the code lets understand Cosine Similarity, Sentiment Analysis, VADER, and NLP(Natural Language Processing) First**...<br></br>

**What is Cosine Similarity?** <br></br>

In the context of natural language processing (NLP), cosine similarity is often used to determine the similarity between two text documents represented as vectors in a high-dimensional space, where each dimension corresponds to a term (word) and the value represents the frequency of that term in the document.<br></br>

**What is Sentiment Analysis?** <br></br>

Sentiment analysis in NLP (Natural Language Processing) refers to the process of determining the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in a piece of text. 
This analysis typically involves classifying the text as positive, negative, or neutral, although more nuanced approaches may involve sentiment scores ranging from very positive to very negative.<br></br>


**What is VADER?** <br></br>
VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a pre-trained model for sentiment analysis that is included in the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library. It is specifically designed to analyze sentiment in social media texts, taking into account the nuances of informal language, slang, and emoticons commonly found in such texts.<br></br>


**What is (NLP)Natural Language Processing**?<br></br>

NLP or Natural language processing is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and linguistics. It is primarily concerned with giving computers the ability to support and manipulate human language.<br></br>

NLP combines computational linguistics‚Äîrule-based modeling of human language‚Äîwith statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. Together, these technologies enable computers to process human language in the form of text or voice data and to ‚Äòunderstand‚Äô its full meaning, complete with the speaker or writer‚Äôs intent and sentiment.<br></br>

NLP drives computer programs that translate text from one language to another, respond to spoken commands, and summarize large volumes of text rapidly‚Äîeven in real time. There‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôve interacted with NLP in the form of voice-operated GPS systems, digital assistants, speech-to-text dictation software, customer service chatbots, and other consumer conveniences. But NLP also plays a growing role in enterprise solutions that help streamline business operations, increase employee productivity, and simplify mission-critical business processes.<br></br>


**Important Note: Go through the documentation for VADER and how it works with NLTK and how vector arithmetic operation happens with the help of cosine similarity before jumping to the code.**
