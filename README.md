# Project--NLP-Sentiment-Analysis-

<table>
  
**In this project we'll be making a Linear SVC(Support Vector Classifier) model for predicting a movie review as a positive review or negative review in Natural Language Processing. It's Part 2 of previous project on this.** <br></br>


**Before jumping to the code lets understand Linear SVC(Model) and NLP(Natural Language Processing) First**...<br></br>

**What is Sentiment Analysis?** <br></br>

Sentiment analysis in NLP (Natural Language Processing) refers to the process of determining the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in a piece of text. 
This analysis typically involves classifying the text as positive, negative, or neutral, although more nuanced approaches may involve sentiment scores ranging from very positive to very negative.<br></br>


**What is (NLP)Natural Language Processing**?<br></br>

NLP or Natural language processing is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and linguistics. It is primarily concerned with giving computers the ability to support and manipulate human language.<br></br>

NLP combines computational linguistics‚Äîrule-based modeling of human language‚Äîwith statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. Together, these technologies enable computers to process human language in the form of text or voice data and to ‚Äòunderstand‚Äô its full meaning, complete with the speaker or writer‚Äôs intent and sentiment.<br></br>

NLP drives computer programs that translate text from one language to another, respond to spoken commands, and summarize large volumes of text rapidly‚Äîeven in real time. There‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôve interacted with NLP in the form of voice-operated GPS systems, digital assistants, speech-to-text dictation software, customer service chatbots, and other consumer conveniences. But NLP also plays a growing role in enterprise solutions that help streamline business operations, increase employee productivity, and simplify mission-critical business processes.<br></br>


**Important Note: Go through the .tsv file which contains the huge list of movie reviews with label (i.e pos vs neg) before jumping to the code.**
